## What is "Random Map Generation"?

In game creation, Random Map Generation is used to provide randomly and dynamically created game environments. 

Each time, a different landscape is produced by the algorithms, which generate the environment at random within the given parameters. 

This implies that the setting changes every time the game is played, making each playthrough new.

## Algorithm explanation
The algorithm will be explain here.

The algorithm consists of 2 parts.

- Part 1:

  Algorithm for map creation.
  
- Part 2:

  Reading and storing art and drawing the map.
  
## Implementation

Here will go all the TODOs.

## Possible improvements
- More parameters to control better how it generates.
- Adding different room types, not just corridors.
- Having an entrance and an exit.
- Adding support for multiple layers of rendering.
- Controlling exceptional really simple cases where only a few rooms spawn (not enough to create a dungeon).
- Some code optimization where possible.
